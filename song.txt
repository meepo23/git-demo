A smile makes a gloomy day brighter,
A rainbow will wake up from a smile in the sky.
Share your smile,
And she will come back to you more than once.

And then for sure
Suddenly the clouds will dance,
And the grasshopper chirps on the violin.
From the blue stream
The river begins,
Well, friendship begins with a smile.
From the blue stream
The river begins,
Well, friendship begins with a smile.
